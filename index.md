<h1 class="Page-title">Slinger of Divs.<br>Pusher of Pixels.</h1>

<p class="Lede">Hey, I’m Josh - proud husband, father of <strike>four</strike> five, novice baker of bread, and lover of finely-crafted stories.</p>

I’m passionate about emerging technologies and implementing creative solutions to complex problems.

Over the past decade, I've had the tremendous opportunity to work with some amazing teams in **Singapore**, **New York City**, and **Lancaster, PA**. I'm currently slinging divs and bringing hope with the fine folks at **Ramsey Solutions in Nashville, TN**.
